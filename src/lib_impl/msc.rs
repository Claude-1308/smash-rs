/// code and the lua consts. For example, the following is an MSC command:
/// ```rs
/// pub fn unable_cancel_status(fighter: &mut L2CFighterCommon) {
///     fighter.clear_lua_stack();
///     fighter.push_lua_stack(L2CValue::new(app::msc_cmd::CANCEL_UNABLE_CANCEL_STATUS));
///     app::sv_module_access::cancel(fighter.lua_state);
///     fighter.pop_lua_stack(1);
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// These commands will get sent off to the respective handler in these structures.
